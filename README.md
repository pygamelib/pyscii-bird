## Installation & Run

First you need the pygamelib 1.3.0 (or 1.2.990+ during the beta version). For the moment, you can only get it from test.pypi.org.

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pygamelib
```

Then you don't really need to install the game, just run pyscii-bird.py:

```bash
python pyscii-bird.py
```
